# Multi-page document using the ":target" pseudo class and minimal JS

1. JavaScript is used to alter the "href" and "more_pages" attributes of the "previous page" and "next page" anchors.
1. CSS is using the :target pseudo class to determine which page to show. All the rest are hidden.
1. CSS to target the "pervious page" and "next page" anchors is present to override the browser behavior for visited links.
